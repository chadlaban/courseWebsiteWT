        <p> The World Wide Web was invented by 
        <a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee<img src="../images/tim-berners-lee.jpg"></a>
        , he is a british computer scientist and was born in London. </p>
        
        <p> Tim Berners-Lee graduated from the Oxford University, and he worked as a Software Engineer at </p>  
        <div class="text">CERN.

        <p> In March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed his vision about the World Wide Web, and called his document "Information Management: A Proposal", his proposal was not immidiately accepted, and his boss (Mike Sendall), wrote a note that it was <a href="#">"Vague but exciting"<img src="../images/proposal.gif"></a> on the cover of the document. The WWW was not an official project of CERN, but Mr. Mike Sendall gave Tim Berners-Lee the time to work on it during September 1990. He used the <a href="#">NeXT computer<img src="../images/nextComputer.jpg"></a>, an early product of Steve Jobs.</p>
        
        <p> On October 1990, Mr. Tim has laready made the three fundamental technologies that remained on today's web. These are the: </p>

        </div>
        
        <p> Tim wrote the first web page editor called the "WorldWideWeb.app" and the first web server ("httpd"). Tim moved to the Massachussetts Institute of Technology in 1994 and founded the </p> <div class="text">W3C <span class="define"> World Wide Web Consortium </span></div> <p>, this is an international community that is devoted to develop open web standards.
