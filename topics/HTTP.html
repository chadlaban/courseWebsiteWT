        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p><b>HTTP</b> is one of the protocols used by the web or the internet. It is an <i>asymmetric request-response client-server</i> protocol, meaning, the client sends a request to a server, then the server, returns a response. <b>HTTP</b> is a <i>pull protocol</i>, meaning, the client pulls information from the server, instead of the server pushing information down to the client.</p>
        
        <p>A <b>qoute from the RFC2616</b>: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers."</p>
        
        
        <h3> The Protocol </h3>
        <p>When you enter a URL in the address box (browser), it will translate the URL into a request message according to which specific protocol and sends that request to the server.</p>
        
        <p>When the request reaches the server, these actions can take place:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    It interprets the request, locates the request under the server's directory, and it returns back the requested information to the client.
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>
                    
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
