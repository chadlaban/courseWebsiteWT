        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p><b>HTTP</b> is one of the protocols used by the web or the internet. It is an <i>asymmetric request-response client-server</i> protocol, meaning, the client sends a request to a server, then the server, returns a response. <b>HTTP</b> is a <i>pull protocol</i>, meaning, the client pulls information from the server, instead of the server pushing information down to the client.</p>
        
        <p>A <b>qoute from the RFC2616</b>: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers."</p>
        
        &nbsp;
        
        <h3> The Protocol </h3>
        <p>When you enter a URL in the address box (browser), it will translate the URL into a request message according to which specific protocol and sends that request to the server.</p>
        
        <p>When the request reaches the server, these actions can take place:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    It interprets the request, locates the request from a file under the server's directory, and it returns back the requested information to the client.
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Interprets the request, locates the program kept inside the server, executes and returns the output to the client.
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>
                     Returns an error message (unsatisfied request).   
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>The browser will return thos response messages, it will interpret and display the contents of the message according to its </p><div class="text">media type.<span class="define">Response headers: text/plain, text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, audio/mpeg, video/mpeg, application/msword, and application/pdf</span></div><p> </p>
        
        &nbsp;
        
        <h3> Specifications </h3>
        
        <h4> Connection </h4>
            <p>The client is the TCP connection initiator of the HTTP. "HTTP" and "HTTPS" shares the same port numbers (80 - HTTP, 443 - HTTPS)</p>
        
        <h4> Frame and Stream </h4>
            <p>Layers that describes the way HTTP are structured (frames) and then formed into streams.</p>
        
        <h4> Frame and Error </h4>
            <p>This are information about the frames and error types used in HTTP.</p>
        
        <h4> HTTP mappings </h4>
            <p>This how the semantics of HTTP are expresses using frames and streams.</p>
        
        &nbsp;
